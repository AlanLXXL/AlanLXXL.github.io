Hi! I'm Xing Lu, a Computer Science student at the University of Nottingham with a strong passion for machine learning and its applications in real-world systems. My current research interests include hyper-heuristics and IoT-based sensing technologies, where I enjoy exploring how smart systems can adapt and learn to make better decisions.

Beyond the academic world, I’m an active person who enjoys sports and going to the gym to stay energized and clear-headed. Music is another big part of my life—I love listening to artists like Taylor Swift and Adele, as well as Mandarin-speaking legends like Li Zongsheng, Wanf Fei, Jay Chou (Jielun Zhou), and Eason Chan (Chen Yixun).

This space is where I share my learning journey, research updates, and reflections on technology, creativity, and life. Thanks for stopping by!
