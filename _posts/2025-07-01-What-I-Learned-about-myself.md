## **It’s Okay to Be Lost: What I Learned About Myself in University**

Today, I attended my father’s 50th birthday. We had cake, chatted about life and the future, and somewhere in the conversation, he asked me why I still don’t have a girlfriend.

It hit me harder than I expected.  
 Not because I haven’t thought about it — I have, many times.  
 But because deep down, I also felt disappointed in myself.

University is almost over. I once imagined that by the time I graduated, I would have everything figured out — perhaps even a great love story to remember. But now that I’m standing at the edge of this chapter, I find myself without many of the things I thought I *should* have. No relationship. No clear future. Just a lot of questions.

But maybe that’s not a failure. Maybe it’s something else.

### **Growth Doesn’t Always Look Like Success**

When I reflect on the past few years, I realise that what I gained is not something you can post on social media.  
 Before I came to the UK, I was anxious and overly focused on academic goals. I rarely thought about myself as a *person*. But being abroad changed me in quiet ways.

I learned how to cook.  
I learned how to take care of myself.  
I learned how to deal with loneliness, and how to talk gently to myself when things fell apart.

That’s not the kind of growth people always talk about — but it’s the kind that stays.

### **Missing Out Isn’t Always a Loss**

It’s easy to regret what you didn’t do. I sometimes think about the chances I didn’t take — the people I didn’t talk to, the love I didn’t pursue, the moments I let slip away.

But I’ve come to believe that we don’t need to meet every expectation society places on us.  
 We don’t need to have everything figured out by 22\.  
 We don’t need to be in a relationship to be complete.  
 We don’t need to compare our timelines with someone else’s highlight reel.

Being *normal*, being *yourself*, and being *at peace* — that’s a success too.

### **Vulnerability Is Strength**

I used to think strength meant pretending everything was fine.  
 Now I know that strength is being able to admit when you’re not okay, and still choosing to show up.

There were dark days — moments of sadness, frustration, and uncertainty. But I had my friends. I had my inner voice. And somehow, I kept going.

I’ve started learning to accept my vulnerability, rather than run from it. There is strength in being broken. There is healing in being honest.

### **Looking Ahead with Hope (and Peace)**

It’s okay to hope for love. I still do.  
 But I’m also learning to enjoy being alone, without feeling *lonely*.  
 I want to be the kind of person who can celebrate others' happiness without envy, and carry my own solitude with grace.

We don’t need to be someone else.  
 We are ourselves — and that is enough.

Sometimes, the most important journey is the one inward.
