## Growing up between sacrifice and expectation — and learning that worth isn’t measured in wins.

The air inside the Go competition hall was heavy and still, thick with summer heat. The temperature outside was close to forty degrees, and yet my parents stayed there the whole day — no complaints, no rest — just to accompany my little brother in his game.

It should have been a memory of love and dedication. But the moment we returned home, the words began.

“We put in so much effort, and you still failed.”  
 “Other children are winning competitions. Why can’t you?”  
 “You’re useless, impatient, without talent.”

The phrases struck me like echoes from my own childhood. I had heard them countless times before — after exams, after competitions, after any moment where my performance wasn’t perfect. Hearing them again, directed at my little brother, was like watching my past replay itself.

### **Growing Up in a Loop**

I grew up as the only child in an Asian family, until my little brother was born. My life was carefully planned around a single definition of success:

* Top student in class.

* Admission to the best junior high.

* Then the best high school.

* And finally, a top university.

Every stage came with the same rule: *failure was not an option.*

When I failed the Gaokao — China’s university entrance exam — it felt like my entire identity collapsed. My parents’ disappointment was sharp, but what hurt most was the voice I had internalized: *You failed because you weren’t good enough.*

### **The Shape of Love**

My parents’ love has always been tied to sacrifice. They gave everything — time, money, energy — to support me and now my brother. When he showed interest in Go or classical guitar, they invested immediately: expensive lessons, long weekend trips for competitions, hours of practice.

But hobbies in my family were never just for joy. They had to be **validated**.

* If you play Go, you must win tournaments.

* If you learn guitar, you must pass certifications and perform at a high level.

Otherwise, it’s “a waste of time.”

The message was clear: the only hobbies worth having are the ones that lead to recognition. And of course, you can’t fail — not after so much has been sacrificed for you.

### **Losing the Joy**

Looking back, I realize how this mindset stripped away my joy. I learned early to measure my worth by achievements. Even when I enjoyed something, the looming pressure to “prove” it drained my enthusiasm.

In high school, the constant pressure and fear of failure led to depression and even physical symptoms — headaches, stomachaches — my body’s way of saying *enough*.

---

### **Seeing Both Sides**

Now, watching my little brother go through the same cycle, I see both sides of the story. I understand my parents’ perspective: they believe sacrifice should lead to success, and success is proof that their love mattered.

But I also know the other side — the suffocating fear, the shrinking sense of self, the way failure starts to feel like a betrayal.

This kind of love is real, but it’s also conditional. And conditional love leaves scars.

---

### **What I Hope Changes**

The purpose of my parents’ approach is good — they want the best for their children. But the outcome is rarely what they imagine. Instead of building confidence, it plants fear. Instead of creating joy, it creates anxiety.

I hope one day, love can mean more than sacrifice tied to expectations. I hope hobbies can be pursued for the joy they bring, not just the medals they win. And I hope my little brother will grow up knowing that failure doesn’t erase his worth.

Because I know, from years of living in that loop, that the greatest victory isn’t winning competitions — it’s learning to be enough, even when you lose.

Sometimes, love wears the mask of a coach, a judge, a critic.  
 But beneath it all, it is still love — fierce, clumsy, and desperate to protect.  
 I have learned that love can guide, but it can also wound,  
 and the truest kind is the one that stays,  
 even when the scoreboard says we’ve lost.
